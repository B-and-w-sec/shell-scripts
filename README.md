# My Bug Bounty shell-scripts
This repo contains scripts i used while bug bounty.

1. relative-url-extract.rb is used with jobert abma's [relative url extractor](https://github.com/jobertabma/relative-url-extractor) to recursively look for url from js files, The script just uses a loop.
2. linkfinder.sh is used with [linkfinder](https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder) script which is also usinga loop to extract links from the js files.
3. Secretsfinder.sh is used with [secretfinder](https://github.com/m4ll0k/SecretFinder) script which is also using a loop to extract links from the js files.
4. subdomain-enum.sh This is my goto subdomain enum script when i was a beginner, A good improvement can be done by scanning more levels of domains and much more!
### Make sure to check and add the tools path correctly in your shell scripts, And move them to /usr/bin
